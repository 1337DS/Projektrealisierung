Sustainalytics’ ESG Risk Ratings assess the degree to which a company’s enterprise business value is at risk driven by environmental, social and governance issues. The rating employs a two-dimensional framework that combines an assessment of a company’s exposure to industry-specific material ESG issues with an assessment of how well the company is managing those issues. The final ESG Risk Ratings scores are a measure of unmanaged risk on an absolute scale of 0-100, with a lower score signaling less unmanaged ESG Risk.
